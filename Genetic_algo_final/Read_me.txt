This code is an implementation of genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP) with 10 nodes. The problem statement involves finding the shortest route visiting all the nodes.

The algorithm starts by randomly initializing a population of 5 chromosomes with a seed number. The cost matrix (COST) is defined which gives the cost of traveling from one node to another. The inverse of the cost is calculated and stored in TOU matrix.

The algorithm then calculates the fitness of each chromosome using calfitness function. The next step is the selection of chromosomes for mating which is done by the selection function. The selected chromosomes then undergo crossover and mutation to form a new population. The process is repeated for 500 generations. The optimum result is obtained in the 470th generation with an optimal cost of 99.

This code can be used to solve TSP problems with 10 nodes and can be extended to larger problems with modifications.
